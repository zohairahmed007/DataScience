2. **Data Preprocessing & Wrangling**
3. **Data Visualization**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Introduction to Machine Learning**
6. **Supervised Learning**
7. **Unsupervised Learning**
8. **Model Evaluation & Optimization**
9. **Advanced Topics (Deep Learning, NLP, etc.)**

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:


- **`lectures/`**: Contains PDF slides and notes from each lecture.
- **`code/`**: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks with examples from the course.
- **`practice/`**: Datasets and Jupyter notebooks for hands-on practice.
- **`exercises/`**: Homework and exercise assignments to reinforce concepts.

## ✨ Getting Started

To start using the materials in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-course.git
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
    Make sure you have Python installed. Use the following command to install dependencies:
